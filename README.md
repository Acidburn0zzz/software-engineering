====================

This was a university project in which we worked in a small group together to produce an ant simulation game. All the files needed to run the game are contained here, as well as the Java source code. All the code sharing was done on GitHub and so you can see all the commit history here too.

###To run from JAR without Apache ant

On *nix (Linux/ OS X etc.) run "./run.sh"
On Windows run "run.bat"

###To run from source with Apache ant
Just type "ant run" in the root folder

###To edit the source

Clone in NetBeans the Git URL
